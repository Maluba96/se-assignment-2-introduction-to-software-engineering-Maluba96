Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

    Software Engineering is an engineering discipline that involes all aspects of producing software. It is the systematic approach to the design, develompent, operation and maintanance of a good quality software system within a budget.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

    Software engineering is concerned with developing reliable software that is efficient and easy to maintain.
    Programming is mainly involved with writing code to solve sicentific problems while Software engineering applies scientific and mathermatical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

    Software Development Life Cycle is a process of minimizing project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations. Development teams use this process to design and build high quality software within an operational budget.

    The SDLC Involves:
    1. Project Initiation Stage - This invoves the process of defining the goals and objectives. Identifying problems, coverage and stakeholders. 
    2. Planning Stage - A project management plan is developed. At this stage, the scope, project schedules and budgets are defined.
    3. Execution - Team members are assigned tasks and project plans begin to be implemented.
    4. Monitoring and Controlling - Key performance indicators(KPIs) and project management tools are used to identify any deviations from the project plan and allow for timely corrective actions to be implemented.
    5. Closure - The business and technical personnel evaluate how well the project was excecuted and a formal acceptance of the system from the customer is made.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

    An Agile model involves an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on adaptability and customer satisfaction. 
    Waterfall models follow a linear and sequential approach to software development.

    1. Waterfall strictly assigns roles with specific duties for team members while agile models empower team members to collaborate on different aspects of the proejct overstime.
    2. Waterfall model requires more time in the beginning to get the plan right, changes are more costly after the project begins. Agile methods are more adaptable to changes in scope,the development team is able to adjust as requirements change.
    
    Agile methodology is necessary for developing software systems that are new to team members and when a bussiness is struggling to find the right solution to their challenge.
    Waterfall processes are used for projects that are not complicated and have clear unchanging goals.


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

    Requirements Engineering provides a framwork of understanding the purpose of a system and the context is will be used in. It bridges the gap between the taskof building a system to address a problem and recognizing the purpose of the system.

    It is important in the Software Develepment Life Cycle because it strictly approaches the definition, creation and verification of requirements of a software system.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

    Modularity is the process of seperating a systems into modules that handle specific functions and operate independently.

    Modularity improves maintainability of a software system by creating a flexible structure that can adapt to change. This ensures that the software remains relevant and functional, creating an extended lifespan of a software product.
    It improves scalability by making the system easy to adapt, extend or replace parts of the system without affecting other parts. This allows for the system to be able to handle increased loads and adding new features.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
    Software testing is the process of assessing and verifying that a software product does what it is supposed to do.

    Unit Testing - The first level of software testing that checks if the modules of a given requirement are satisfying or not. It is also the first level of functional testing,  primarily to validate unit components with their performance. it is important for testing the corrrectness of inaccessible code.

    Intergration Testing - It is used to test the flow of data from one software component to another. This process identifies the defects at the interaction between intergrated units.

    System Testing - In this stage, all the necessary modules of an application checked through and the end features of a product are tested. This process examines the entire working of an intergrated Software Computer System against requirements.

    Acceptance testing - This process is used to evaluate if a specification or the requirements are met as per its delivery. End users can identify minor errors that were not identified during the previous software testing stages. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is done by the customer before accepting the final product.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

    Version Control is the process of tracking anf managing changes to siftware code. this helps software teams manage code over time, work faster and smarter. if a mistake is made, developers can identify and fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

    A version control software allows developers to manage saved changes in a repository. If a mistake is made, software developers are able to undo it.

    1. GitHub - A distributed version conttrol system that allows software teams to collaborate and maintain the history of code changes. 
    Git is an open source version control system that features local branching (Changes you introoduce and comit to your local repository are stored only on your local system), multiple workflows and convinient staging areas. 
    Each team member has a copy of the entire codebase on their local machine. They can work offline and merge their changes with the main codebase when ready.

    2. Apache Subversion - It is a free and open-source version control system that enables programmers to manage prebious iterations of crucial files. It can track changes to source code, web ages, and documentation for large-scale projects. 

    3. Azure DevOps - It is a software technology that allows developers to access controls and permissions, track bugs, continuous intergration and collaborate in managing code.

    
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

    A Software Project manager is responsible for organizing software projects and assigning tasks to software teams. Software managers use their leadership skills and technical experience to direct their teams to ensure that software meets client requirements.

    Key responsibilities include:
    1. Project Scope - This includes defining project boundaries. Setting deliverables and objectives. A work breakdown Structure is created in this phase.
    2. Schedule - This involves developing a detailed timeline with milestones e.g. defining all user requirements are met by a specific time frame. Schedules can be set using tools like Gant Charts.
    3. Budget - Estimating cost resources, materials and equipment is essential in the development cycle. The likelihooh of each risk is assessed, for example, in a case that if one of the Engineers is unavailable to complete the project, a budgdet could be set for additional labor.
    4. Risk Management - This process involves the development of a risk mitigation strategy.
    5. Tools and Technologies - A critical path method technique allows for the identification of tasks that are necessary for project completion.
    roject management software is used to help businesses and individuals track projects, tasks and schedules e.g. Microsoft Project and Jira



Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

    Software Maintanance is a process used to monitor and maintain software by modifying a software product to correct faults and improve performance. The software is a model of the real world. When the real world changes, the software requires alterations and changes wherever possible.

    Software maintanance is important as it:

    1. Offers protection from bugs and software problems.
    Maintanance programs allow your software to stay in warranty. This process ensures a long term investment of software systems.
    2. Most maintanance programs include upgrading components. upgrades are necessary to make the program worthwhile.
    3. Regular updates and software maintanance will allow you to keep up with software development trends and ensure that your business is effecient and effective.
    4. Covering software bugs and upgrading/updating your software products can help to reduce IT expenditure to a maintanance fee. This means that large unexpected costs will be eliminated.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

    Ethical considerations are a set of principles that guide your research designs and practices.

    Some ethical issues that software enginners might face include:
    1. Algorithimic Bias - Computers can not understand morality as a concept. Systems can unintentionally show bias when not thoroughly checked e.g. When Google was called out for systematic racism because it was discovered that its processing engine could not adequately reflect black and briwn skin tones in images.

    2. Weak security - Software is prone to security issues. Training of developers to learn and implement proper security practices is limited to Cybersecurity-specific seminars.

    3. Privacy - Professionals mcay sometimes be called upon to access peoples documents and personal information, like an employees browsing history.

    Geographic information system (GIS) users now have to deal with a new privacy concern pertaining to location security. For instance, the British Columbian Forest Practices Code requires the preservation of First Nations' (indigenous peoples') cultural sites; nevertheless, locating these sites in a GIS may reveal their positions for unethical exploitation.

    4. Data Collection - Many firms use digital consumer data to help make decisions, it is important that data is collected in an ethical manner.

    How Software Engineers can ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work:

    1. When data is collected and used without consent, consumers feel a loss of trust. Professionals can prevent this issue by asking for consent for data collection.
    2. It is important for professionals to exercise discretion and respect other people's right to privacy.
    3.  Software experts have to take the initiative in learning security protocols through the plenty of development resources e.g. websites like Stack Overflow, to strengthen ones skills and knowledge about cybersecurity.
    Engineers can also refer to protection guidelines. For example, if a health Application is being developed, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) can be used as a guiding reference.
    4. Engineers can prevent system bias by ensuring that the training data used to develop algorithms is diverse and represantative of the pipulation it serves.
